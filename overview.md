*Subject: Request for ER Diagram Design for Liquidity Risk Management Database*

#### Dear Database Design Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our risk management capabilities, we are developing a new SQL database to specifically track and analyse liquidity risk within our investment company. This database will enable us to monitor liquidity positions, manage risk more effectively, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

To proceed with this project, I would like to request the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that outlines the structure of this database. Below are the key components and relationships that need to be included:

#### Entities and Attributes

1.  **Customers**
    -   CustomerID (Primary Key)
    -   FirstName
    -   LastName
    -   DateOfBirth
    -   Email
    -   Phone
    -   Address
    -   City
    -   State
    -   ZipCode
    -   Country
    
2.  **Accounts**
    -   AccountID (Primary Key)
    -   CustomerID (Foreign Key)
    -   AccountType
    -   Balance
    -   CreatedAt
   
3.  **Transactions**
    -   TransactionID (Primary Key)
    -   AccountID (Foreign Key)
    -   TransactionType
    -   Amount
    -   TransactionDate

4.  **Liquidity_Positions**
    -   PositionID (Primary Key)
    -   AccountID (Foreign Key)
    -   LiquidityType (e.g., Cash, MarketableSecurities)
    -   Value
    -   AsOfDate
    
5.  **Liquidity_Risks**
    -   RiskID (Primary Key)
    -   PositionID (Foreign Key)
    -   RiskType (e.g., FundingRisk, MarketLiquidityRisk)
    -   RiskValue
    -   AssessmentDate

### Relationships
-   Each **Customer** can have multiple **Accounts** (One-to-Many).
-   Each **Account** can have multiple **Transactions** (One-to-Many).
-   Each **Account** can have multiple **Liquidity Positions** (One-to-Many).
-   Each **Liquidity Position** can be associated with multiple **Liquidity Risks** (One-to-Many).

### Additional Requirements
-   The ER diagram should clearly illustrate the primary and foreign key relationships between the entities.
-   Include any necessary constraints to maintain data integrity, such as ensuring that transactions cannot exist without a related account, and liquidity risks cannot exist without a related liquidity position.
-   Consider future scalability in the design, allowing for additional entities and relationships as needed.

Please let me know if you need any further information or clarification on this request. We aim to have the initial design completed by 13/04/2025 , so your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your cooperation and support.
